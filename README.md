## Information about The Site

This repo hosts all of the files for my personal site. It's public so if you're interested in seeing how I built it feel free to take a look! I'm currently using Elventy to build the site. Enjoy ðŸ’š

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see all updates to this project.

## Technologies Used

- **[Elventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)**
  is a static site generator that is not tied to a javascript framework and can be easily implemented into any developers' workflow. I decided to move to this static site generator as I wanted something simple to use with my own personal and side projects. Other static site generators are feature rich, but for smaller projects, I wanted to step away from javascript frameworks whilst keeping the benefits of SSGs.

- **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)**
  is a css preprocessor that I've recently fallen back in love with. I have a lot of love for Tailwind, but I enjoy Sass just as much! I enjoy having separate .scss files and folders, it helps me keep my styles organised and I can tweak them to my preferences with ease.

- **[Templating Languages like Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)**
  I don't have much experience with templating languages other than HTML and Markdown, so I've been learning languages like Nunjucks as I go. I love that I get the bennefits of component based development with the choice of using the file types I like, such as Markdown files for my blog pages, and Nunjuck files for my main pages.

[changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

I was inspired to try 11ty by [Kevin Powell's site](https://github.com/kevin-powell/new-website), with some design inspiration coming from [Michael Soolee](https://michaelsoolee.com/), [Thi](https://dinhanhthi.com/), and [Delibroom](https://delibroom.com/)
